### Career Objective

I am qualified to become the Software Architect of a valuable corporate information system.

I'd be happy to work under a corporate master, and can lead small teams.

While I that opportunity finds me, I can steer or move your systems in that direction.


### Roles by project

Over time my emphasis has shifted to higher level functions, away from developing projects 
for my social groups and I out of passion and toward stable operations.

** Visualization status: Draft **

The idea behind the visualizations is to scrape data from the HTML generated from Markdown.
The code has portions written but some are broken. Nothing useful is displayed.

MD data makes it easy to maintain with a simple text editor. JS manipulation is a proof-of-concept,
with another approach being to write custom code and organize pages by tag or path, for example. The later,
path, would require upgrade to a later version of Cryogen that supports it... should be drop-in simple.
