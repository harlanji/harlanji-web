{:title "Maslow's Needs Quantified"
 :layout :post}

Building on an idea I've [touched on before](/2019-01-14-self-actualization) 
paired with some [new thinking](https://faracrosstherubicon.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/rethinking-maslow-a-postmodern-take-on-human-motivation-theory/), 
I've created a visual representation of well being. I included a present, and
a reference example from my recollection of roughly 2015-16 era, shortly after
moving to SF. For those unaware, I became homeless after slander from a manager at a 
big name company destroyed my reputation and I was unable to continue my career and 
depleted my savings.

## Conclusions

There was a total inversion between these periods. While my health and nutrition have vastly improved since
that time, everything else has failed pretty abrubtly. The lack of income and housing make most higher level 
needs unattainable. Prior family was my weak link and it remains so. It would be an anchor that could help 
lift me up, and indeed when I was younger they indirectly assisted me by providing housing. The offer 
is still on the table but I refuse it because the health would suffer.

Not much needs to be said verbally since the layout of the graphic is pretty natural and patterns can be 
inferred. If a lower level contains little or no green, it is unlikely that a higher level will contain green.
Previously I started thinking about how to quantify one's position and choose action based on that value,
and this is indeed one step closer. I still like the exponential energy requirement line of thinking
from previously, as it seems to extend to forcing success with money, upon a cursory look.
