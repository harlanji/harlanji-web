Here we go with another revision to the resume. 

[![Resume](/img/2019-03-06-resume/resume-software-eng.png)](/img/2019-03-06-resume/resume-software-eng.pdf)


Most feedback was to take the Day Labor job off, even
though it's current. I've noticed patterns in feedback and may bring it back from time to time, but 
overall I think I'll leave it off. I can refer to what I am presently doing verbally, and the 
consensus is that software engineers don't need to explain gaps in their employment. Plus I have 
a long and diverse history. But the argument I like for keeping it on, is that it shows I am actively
doing something for work, and in a sense it's not glamorous and can explain non-verbals to recruiters,
such as being dressed shabby or talking like an uneducated person.

The latter point and this whole process has made me aware that I need to interact with educated people more.
I've been put into isolation in a sense for making people too uncomfortable with my Honey Boo Boo 
conservative values, but the more a person is isolated the worse they become... I digress for now.

I've also been working on my website / portfolio more, and shortened the link so it'd fit directly
in the resume header. I removed the title of "Software Engineering Professional" to make some space,
but I kinda like it. In a sense most people who get the resume should know what I do, but not everyone
may. The uniform titles kinda give it away.
