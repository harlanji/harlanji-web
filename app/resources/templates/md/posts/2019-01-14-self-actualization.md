When a lower order need is not met then it is non-sensical to prove into needs
that are at a higher level, such as during a job interview. It is a useful tool
because when in a lower state it becomes increasingly difficult for self
assessment. Learn this while in the self-actualization stage, and observe
your energy levels when you are deficient of lower order needs, and 
notice  and how much
harder it becomes to do higher order functions.
