Do we render the Tweets here to HTML or use EDN and do it in the template?

  We can do it today using the template.

Intuition says in template.

But it would be nice if there were a way to read data as a first class citizen.

A .edn extension as opposed to .md would be an intuitive starting point. Durr.

Meanwhile a script could be used to render the markdown from the EDN on a case-by-case basis.
