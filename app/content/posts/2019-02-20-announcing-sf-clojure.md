I’ve created a new Clojure group in San Francisco: [SF Clojure](http://meetup.com/SF-Clojure).

I love Clojure and feel up the the challenge of organizing 
a community around the ecosystem. The astute reader may be 
aware that there is an existing Bay Area Clojure (BAC) 
group and ask why I don’t simply join that group, or 
perhaps you’ve interacted with me at that group and 
enjoyed my frequent small contributions. I was indeed 
an active member and always had engaging and thought provoking 
conversations with the members, dating back at least a couple 
of years.

#### Why would I create a second group?

The creation was, unfortunately, in response to being frivolously 
barred from participation in the existing BAC group during the 
last meeting, due to an online mob incited by a present member 
and presumably absent organizer. I’d been a part of it for at 
least a year or two and had made a number of contacts there, 
and always got along well with everyone and have nothing ill 
to say about it.

#### Why was I removed from the first group?

I was removed for unrelated Tweets and it was a two step process. 
First, a new organizer (“Katie” IIRC, 
with green hair) confronted me in person at the meeting and 
asked that I re-write my name tag to not include my @harlanji 
handle on it, because somebody went to my Twitter timeline and 
was uncomfortable with the content there. No comment about
Instagram or Hacker News or GitHub or etc, which use the same handle.
I thanked her for 
letting me stay (given my history of similar frivolous 
complaints in SF history; go Cal!!!), 
and continued the evening right through having a pleasant 
conversation with her about Kafka and the water cycle and 
then walking to the Muni station with 2 other participants. 
After I’d returned home and got on Twitter and into my email, 
I found that while the meet up was still in progress there’d 
been a Twitter mob and another organizer (Zach Tellman) had 
removed me from the group. After a couple of day cool down period, 
I attempted to convince him that his move was unreasonable but 
he reiterated that Tweets containing “hate speech” and “veiled 
threats of violence” are not acceptable—regardless of whether 
any of it happened or was related to the group or meeting itself. 
This means that a Felon or anyone with past publicity that makes 
a member uncomfortable is susceptible to being kicked out of the 
group (criminal records are public). The decision to kick me out 
of the group seemed unilateral, so I asked that the latter organizer 
share my conversation thread with the former and bid him farewell—please, 
put in a word of support for me if you disagree with the decision.

#### Will I keep running the group if the ban is lifted?

It’s possible. I didn’t do it right away because it requires 
Meetup Pro which is $15/mo and I am literally starving to death, but 
I got a nice Patreon payout and decided to pull the trigger on it. 
I think I have the experience and network to run it well, and given 
that the existing group is 5 years old I imagine that it’s getting 
kind of stale. I’d like to be allowed back to the existing group, 
but the totality of the situation and my relationship with Silicon 
Valley may warrant ongoing maintenance of the group. The plan is to 
have group meetings at the same time and at nearby venues to the existing 
group, to siphon off members. Getting a venue and giving talks until 
I can attract more speakers will be enjoyable. So yes, I could keep 
running it perhaps on a 2 week phase shift and deeper focus on 
amateur and “second chance” people like Felons, Trump supporters, 
comedians, and seniors.
