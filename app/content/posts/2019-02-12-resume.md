Here's a revised version of my resume. I got feedback from a
job-readiness program and a guest software engineer. 
Frequent feedback is that I should have more metrics;  
I seem to focus on the qualatative aspects of what I do in written form,
and never have trouble quantifying what I have written. Upon first review, I 
may not be able to quantify everything but once finalized I can go back
to note important quantities for vocal delivery. 
Confidentiality also protects many concrete metrics, 
unfortunately.

I continue to list the Day Laborer position because it shows that I am actively
doing something for money. I added the iSpooge Daily work despite it being
self-directed, because I developed important work during that time. I have
been apprehensive to list it due to experience with dishonest companies.
