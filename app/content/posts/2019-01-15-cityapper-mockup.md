{:title "CityApper Mockup"
 :layout :post}

In [our last installment of CityApper](/2018-12-21-logo-sketch-2) we were sketching a logo. In this round,
we use the same tool, InkScape, to sketch a layout. It was recursive starting
with the box on the Services page and menu bar. Then thinking through the 
services that I could offer. Then when the mockup was done, I copied it whole-sale
to the Labs page. I toggle the bold to indicate a selection, and made the
document have 2x the width. I then built the Labs page. Same process for
additional pages. None of this was screencasted.

I did [a screencast](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/364603229) that took about 2 hours to convert the wire frame to HTML
using our blog engine of choice Cryogen.

Here are the screens:
