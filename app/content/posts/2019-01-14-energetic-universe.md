This is a doodle that captures an important idea. I don't have much bandwidth
to do this type of work so it has to be very splash and go without much fine 
attention to detail. The idea is that as I complete dozens of doodles without
much regard for "editing" I will naturally make better drawings by instinct alone.
I can study each drawing and visualize the improvements without actually making
them.
