I began vlogging in late 2017 during a sabbatical without pre-determined subject matter. I bought some 
equipment that looked useful and had decent reviews, knowing that I was going to create project but 
not knowing what it would be... giving myself about a month to figure it out... "I'll know by Jan 1".

I began by recording myself cooking some recipes from Blue Apron and P1lated, in order to get practice
with the equipment and software. I went on to record the first episode of TinyDC on NYE and continued 
recording episodes.
