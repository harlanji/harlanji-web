{:title "Jain Eating"
 :layout :page}



Jain eating is delicious, but requires care when going out.

No places on the list are totaly Jain. I describe a little about
each. 

I've mainly eaten Jain-compatible food from markets, 
but going out is one way to acquire new tastes and find
the limits of the cuisine.

It seems accepted that in some cases one must 'look the other way'
in terms of cross contamination and staff attitude toward the food.
