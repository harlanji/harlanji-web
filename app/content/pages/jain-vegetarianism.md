{:title "Jain Eating around Mountain View and San Francisco"
 :layout :page}


Jain eating is delicious, but requires care when going out.

Not one place on the list is fully Jain, yet.

I tell some info, like where each is, and 
write a few notes about it like the location or suggested dishes.

I've mainly eaten Jain-compatible food from markets, 
like fruits/fruitarian and beans.
Going out is a great
way to acquire new tastes and find the best cuisine.

Service wise, it seems accepted that in many cases while dining out
 one must 'look the other way' in terms of cross contamination and 
staff attitude toward the food.

I list places I've tried first. Followed by places most free of flesh, dairy, and roots.

Verify the places, of course. As I try more I will improve this page.
